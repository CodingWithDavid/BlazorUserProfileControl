# Project to demo an User profile control

I have always like the cool user control where it has your picture in the upper right of the application.  With this project I have built what I think is a very good control.

The supporting view, such as Edit profile etc. are not included.

*** PLEASE NOTE THIS REQUIRES .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022 ***

## Why

I am in the process of rounding out my UI library so I can build several applications I have had on my list for a while.  This is an User Profile component that allows the user to manage their profile.  It has the additional feature of show how many alerts the user has.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/UserProfileComponentDemo
   cd UserProfileComponentDemo
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. HTML and CSS for the visual profile control
2. C# is used to provide a list of actions the user can perform
3. It uses parameters for the list of actions the user has and for the number of alerts to display.

## Worth Noting
Images were used to instead of icons for a change of pace.
